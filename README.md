# PopBot
Pop bot is a facebook messenger gem built to easily expand on its tasks

The message and postback processors are designed to relay a reponse without any coupling

# Installation
Clone, install gems and setup the database and you're good to go.

To test on Facebook Messenger I recomment using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to open a tunnel from your dev
environment.

This app is tested with Rspec. You can run tests with
```bash
$ rspec spec
```


# Pipline
I haven't added Spotify functionality just yet.
Newfeed is on command, not schedule. But Scheduling from this point shouldn't take long.

#UserData
This application saves a Facebook_id, first_name and timezone

#Moving forward
I'd love to talk though some of my motivations behind the development decisions if possible!
